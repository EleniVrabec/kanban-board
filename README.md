- **Move Tasks:** Drag and drop tasks between columns to update their status.
- **Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks that are no longer needed.
- **Real-time Updates:** All changes are reflected in real-time using Firebase as the backend.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript:** For dynamic behavior, including drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Firebase:** Used as the backend to store and retrieve tasks.
